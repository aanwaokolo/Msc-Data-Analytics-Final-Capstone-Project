# MSc Capstone Project: Predictive Modelling for Respiratory Illness

## 📌 Project Summary
This capstone project, completed as part of my MSc in Data Analytics at De Montfort University, explores the use of predictive analytics to predict illness for patients with respiratory illnesses in a healthcare setting as a way of reducing wait times. The objective is to propose a machine learning approach to support reduce patient waiting times in the NHS by using predictive models during the Triage process to reduce wait time.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## 📈 Key Tasks
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature selection
- Predictive modelling using classification and regression
- Model evaluation

## 🧠 Outcome
The model provides insights into the feasibility of using historical patient data to buildi machine learning models to predict respiratory illnesses, it demonstrates the technical approach for future implementation in NHS contexts.
